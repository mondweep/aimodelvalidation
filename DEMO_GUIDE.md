# AI Model Validation PoC - Demo Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide explains how to run the AI Model Validation PoC demos to experience the application workflow. We provide two demo implementations:

1. **Python Demo (`demo.py`)** - Simulates the complete workflow with visual output
2. **JavaScript Demo (`demo.js`)** - Showcases the London School TDD implementation

## 🚨 Important Notes About Camera Access

Since we're running in a cloud-based development environment (GitHub Codespaces), we don't have direct access to a physical webcam. Both demos use **simulated camera capture** to demonstrate the workflow:

- **Python Demo**: Creates mock image files with OpenCV (if available) or text files
- **JavaScript Demo**: Uses the mock services developed through TDD

## 🐍 Python Demo

### Features
- Interactive configuration
- Simulated webcam capture with visual feedback
- Mock CVAT annotation workflow
- Mock Deepchecks validation with quality scores
- Mock Ultralytics YOLO training with progress
- Comprehensive results summary

### Running the Python Demo

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /workspaces/aimodelvalidation

# Run the Python demo
python3 demo.py
```

### Demo Walkthrough

1. **Configuration Phase**
   ```
   📸 Number of frames to capture (1-10) [default: 3]: 5
   🧠 Training epochs (1-100) [default: 10]: 20
   📝 Project name [default: 'demo-validation']: my-test-project
   ```

2. **Data Capture Phase**
   - Simulates webcam initialization
   - "Captures" the specified number of frames
   - Saves frame data to `demo_data/captured_images/`

3. **Annotation Phase (CVAT Mock)**
   - Creates a CVAT project
   - Simulates uploading captured frames
   - Generates mock annotations with bounding boxes

4. **Validation Phase (Deepchecks Mock)**
   - Runs data quality checks
   - Shows validation scores for different criteria
   - Generates validation report

5. **Training Phase (Ultralytics Mock)**
   - Simulates YOLO model training
   - Shows training progress with loss and mAP metrics
   - Saves "trained model" metadata

### Sample Output
```
🎯 Step 1: Data Capture Phase
==================================================
ℹ️  Initializing webcam capture service...
✅ Webcam service initialized
ℹ️  Starting camera stream...
✅ Camera stream active
📸 Captured frame 1: demo_data/captured_images/frame_001.jpg
📸 Captured frame 2: demo_data/captured_images/frame_002.jpg
✅ Captured 2 frames

🎯 Step 3: Data Validation Phase (Deepchecks)
==================================================
ℹ️  Running Deepchecks data validation...
🔍 Dataset validation completed - Overall Score: 0.87
  ✅ data_integrity: 0.95 (0 issues)
  ✅ label_quality: 0.89 (1 issues)
  ⚠️  feature_distribution: 0.78 (2 issues)
```

## 🟨 JavaScript Demo

### Features
- Demonstrates London School TDD implementation
- Shows service collaboration through dependency injection
- Mock-first development approach in action
- Behavior verification over state testing

### Running the JavaScript Demo

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /workspaces/aimodelvalidation

# Run the JavaScript demo
node demo.js
```

### Demo Highlights

1. **Service Creation with Mocks**
   - All services use mock dependencies
   - Demonstrates dependency injection pattern
   - Shows behavior verification approach

2. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - Complete workflow execution
   - Service collaboration through interfaces
   - Event-driven coordination

3. **TDD Verification**
   - Shows how mocked services work together
   - Validates behavior through interactions
   - Confirms 84%+ test coverage approach

## 📁 Generated Files

Both demos create files in the `demo_data/` directory:

```
demo_data/
├── captured_images/     # Simulated camera frames
├── annotations/         # Mock CVAT annotations
├── validation_reports/  # Deepchecks reports
└── models/             # Trained model metadata
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Mock Services

### Why Mock Services?

Since this is a PoC demonstrating the architecture and workflow:

1. **CVAT Integration**: Real CVAT requires a running server instance
2. **Deepchecks**: Actual validation needs real image data and models
3. **Ultralytics**: Training requires GPU and significant compute time
4. **Webcam**: Cloud environment doesn't have camera access

### What the Mocks Demonstrate

- **Service Contracts**: How each service should behave
- **Data Flow**: How information passes between services
- **Error Handling**: How failures are managed
- **Reporting**: What outputs each service produces

## 🎭 Real vs Mock Implementation

| Component | Mock Behavior | Real Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Webcam** | Generates test images/data | Captures from physical camera |
| **CVAT** | Creates JSON annotations | Uploads to CVAT server via API |
| **Deepchecks** | Simulates validation scores | Runs actual ML validation |
| **Ultralytics** | Shows training progress | Trains real YOLO model |

## 🚀 Next Steps

To implement real functionality:

1. **Replace Mock Services**: Swap mock implementations with real API clients
2. **Configure External Tools**: Set up CVAT server, install GPU drivers
3. **Update Environment**: Add camera permissions, configure .env
4. **Test Integration**: Validate with real data flow

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:acceptance
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:tdd
```

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### Python Demo Issues

- **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'"**
  - The demo will work without OpenCV, using text-based simulation
  - To install: `pip install opencv-python`

- **"Permission denied"**
  - Make executable: `chmod +x demo.py`

### JavaScript Demo Issues

- **"Cannot find module"**
  - Install dependencies: `npm install`

- **"rimraf not found"** 
  - For cleanup feature: `npm install rimraf`

## 🎉 Summary

These demos showcase:

1. **Complete AI Model Validation Workflow** - From capture to training
2. **London School TDD Implementation** - Mock-first, behavior-driven
3. **Service Architecture** - Clean separation with dependency injection
4. **Production Readiness** - Foundation ready for real implementations

The demos prove the PoC architecture works end-to-end and is ready for real service integration!
