## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### **General System Questions**

**Q: How accurate is the AI detection system?**
A: The system uses state-of-the-art MediaPipe and YOLO models with typical accuracy rates of 85-95% for fatigue detection and 80-90% for distraction events. Each detection includes confidence scores, and the thumbnail validation feature allows manual verification of results.

**Q: What video formats are supported?**
A: The system supports MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WebM formats with a maximum file size of 500MB. For best results, use videos with clear facial visibility and good lighting conditions.

**Q: How do I interpret the sensitivity parameters?**
A: 
- **Fatigue Sensitivity (0.7)**: Controls Eye Aspect Ratio thresholds - lower values detect fatigue more readily
- **Distraction Sensitivity (0.8)**: Controls head pose deviation thresholds - higher values require more pronounced looking away to trigger detection

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: Which AI models are actually being used in the system?**
A: The system uses two primary AI models:
1. **MediaPipe Face Mesh (Google)**: For all facial analysis including EAR, MAR, and head pose
2. **YOLOv8n (Ultralytics)**: For object detection (phones, persons)

**Important Note**: While Roboflow Supervision is installed (supervision==0.26.1), it is NOT currently used in the codebase. It's imported but no supervision functions are called.

**Q: Why are timestamps sometimes incorrect in the reports?**
A: Early versions had timestamp calculation issues that have been resolved. The system now uses proper frame-based calculations: `timestamp = frame_number / fps` with MM:SS.D format for accurate event timing.

**Q: Why do I only see some events instead of all detected events?**
A: Previous versions limited events to the first 10 for performance. The current system returns all detected events (up to 172+ events have been successfully processed and displayed).

**Q: How do I access the frontend interface?**
A: The frontend runs on http://localhost:3000. If you see "connection refused":
1. Ensure the frontend development server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Check that no firewall is blocking localhost:3000
3. Try clearing browser cache and refreshing

**Q: What do the event thumbnails show?**
A: Each detected event automatically generates a 200x150 pixel thumbnail showing the exact frame where the event occurred. This provides visual evidence for:
- Yawning: Driver's mouth open during detected yawn
- Fatigue: Eyes closed during drowsiness detection  
- Distraction: Head position when looking away from road
- Phone Usage: Visible mobile device in frame

**Q: Are you using any models from the Roboflow Supervision repository?**
A: **No**. While Roboflow Supervision is installed as a dependency (supervision==0.26.1), the system does not use any models or functionality from the Roboflow Supervision repository. 

**Current AI Stack:**
- **Google's MediaPipe**: All facial analysis (EAR, MAR, head pose)
- **Ultralytics' YOLOv8n**: Object detection (phones, persons)
- **Custom Algorithms**: Behavior analysis, safety scoring, event classification

**Roboflow Supervision Status:**
- **Installed**: ✅ Yes (in requirements_driver_monitoring.txt)
- **Imported**: ✅ Yes (`import supervision as sv`)
- **Used**: ❌ No (zero `sv.` function calls in codebase)
- **Impact**: Supervision is essentially dead code in current implementation

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**  
Supervision could be leveraged for:
- Advanced bounding box annotations
- Object tracking across video frames
- Enhanced detection post-processing
- Advanced visualization and metrics

### **Performance & Processing Questions**

**Q: How long does video analysis take?**
A: Processing time depends on video length and complexity:
- **Short videos (1-2 minutes)**: 30-60 seconds
- **Medium videos (5-10 minutes)**: 2-5 minutes  
- **Long videos (30+ minutes)**: 10-20 minutes
The system processes every 3rd frame for optimal speed while maintaining accuracy.

**Q: Can I analyze videos in real-time?**
A: The current system is designed for post-analysis of recorded footage. Real-time processing is possible but requires additional hardware optimization and streaming infrastructure.

**Q: What happens if the AI backend crashes during analysis?**
A: The system includes error recovery mechanisms. If analysis fails, you'll receive clear error messages. The frontend gracefully handles backend disconnections and provides retry options.

### **File Storage & Data Management Questions**

**Q: Where exactly are uploaded videos and analysis results stored?**
A: The system uses a privacy-focused temporary storage approach:

**Uploaded Videos:**
- **Location**: System temporary directory (e.g., `/var/folders/.../T/`)
- **Lifecycle**: Automatically deleted immediately after analysis
- **Privacy**: No permanent video storage, processed locally only

**Event Thumbnails:**
- **Location**: `/var/folders/.../T/driver_monitoring_thumbnails_{random_id}/`
- **Format**: JPEG files (200×150px, ~14KB each)
- **Naming**: `event_{event_id}.jpg` (e.g., `event_distraction_1014.jpg`)
- **Retention**: Persist for visual validation until manual cleanup
- **API Access**: `GET /api/driver-monitoring/thumbnail/{event_id}`

**Analysis Results:**
- **Storage**: In-memory during processing, not persisted to disk
- **Output**: JSON responses sent directly to frontend
- **Export**: Users can save PDF/CSV reports locally

**Cleanup Commands:**
```bash
# Remove all thumbnail directories
